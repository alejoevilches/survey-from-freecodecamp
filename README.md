This is the first project of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It`s a form to become a River Plate supporter. 

ItÂ´s made with pure CSS, using zero libraries. This is because I wanted to do the challenge in the way freeCodeCamp recomends it. But you`re welcome to suggest any other modification!
